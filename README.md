👋 Hi, I'm @zayyan353!

👀 I'm interested in all things related to technology, programming, and artificial intelligence. I'm fascinated by the potential of AI to revolutionize various industries and improve people's lives.

🌱 Currently, I'm learning new programming languages and exploring advanced machine learning techniques. I'm also diving deeper into web development and cloud computing to broaden my skill set.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open-source projects that involve AI, natural language processing, or web development. I believe in the power of collaboration to create innovative solutions and drive positive change.

📫 You can reach me via email at zaynnnn3@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn (https://linkedin.com/in/zayyan-syafiq-mudzaky). Feel free to reach out for any collaboration or just to chat about technology and AI!
